This repository includes "simulation output data" presented in the research article entitled
"Quantitative evaluation of the lunar seismic scattering and comparison between the Earth, Mars, and the Moon"
by Onodera et al.

In Simulation_data directory, simulated seismic waves are stored in csv format.
The first column is time from the origin time, the second is the vertical velocity (nm/s),
the third is the radial velocity (nm/s), and the forth is the transverse velocity (nm/s).

The synthetic time series was donwsampled to 6.6 Hz so that one can directory compare them
with the Apollo long-period data. Also, the bandpass filtering between 0.3 and 1.5 Hz 
with 4-th order Butterworth fileter was applied to all synthetics.

In case you use these data in your research project, please cite the paper below:
